REMINDERS
====================//
+ test every new word before signing off
+ slowly move dictionary words into adjacentevaluation(). reason: broader reach
+ remember to update ships and github
+ steam workshop updates should get a fixed word list in each changelog

TO DO
================//
+ finish off the adjacent renovations
+ have a think about removing the silent letter option or not. which is better?
+ design a class that reports known adjacent words and prints a list of changes in success. move reminders into the docoumentation.
+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation. this one is easy to screw up

+ marek PIH is too quiet. marek phonemes need to be the same length; even small ones. drag them out
+ see if its feasible to use marek consonants
+ test words before overwriting

+ add new words.
+ create new private mod and script just for testing
+ edit the batch file to point to this new directory

+ an interface should be designed for SentenceProcession so that all different voices can have the same structure, but different spacing when needed
+ it may be possible to rip ACAT apart for pronunciation and pitch. C# baby!
+ use autotune free trial to create pitch.

+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input

+ make a new block with a sound emitter entity? maybe

+ document everything
