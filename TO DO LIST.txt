REMINDERS
====================//
+ test every new word before signing off
+ remember to update the version number for new patches
+ steam workshop updates should get a fixed word list in each changelog
+ dont worry about updating the script. ill replace it with a block eventually.
+CMU dictionary needs to be commented out in order to debug.

TO DO
================//
+ dictionary fetching method must be able to handle any number of phonemes per word.

+ design a class that reports known adjacent words and prints a list of changes in success. move reminders into the docoumentation.
+ some state paths can be combined in adjacent evaulation. this one is easy to screw up
+ bring back silent blocks?

+ study old work in saved audacity project ._.
+ marek PIH is too quiet. marek phonemes need to be the same length; even small ones. drag them out
+ see if its feasible to use marek consonants
+ test words before overwriting

+ add new words.
+ create new private mod and script just for testing
+ edit the batch file to point to this new directory

+ an interface should be designed for SentenceProcession so that all different voices can have the same structure, but different spacing when needed
+ use autotune free trial to create pitch.

+ make a new block with a sound emitter entity? maybe

+ find out if you can move entity with mouse input

+ document everything
